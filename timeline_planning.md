### **Gantt Chart Structure**

You can use the above breakdown to create a Gantt chart with the following columns:

1. **Task Name**: The name of each task.
2. **Start Date**: When you plan to start each task.
3. **End Date**: When you plan to complete each task.
4. **Duration**: How long each task will take (in days or weeks).
5. **Dependencies**: Any tasks that must be completed before others can start.

### **Sample Gantt Chart Representation**

Hereâ€™s a visual representation of how you might structure your Gantt chart:

| Task Name                                       | Start Date | End Date   | Duration | Dependencies              |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Planning Phase                                  | Day 1      | Day 7      | 1 Week   | -                         |
| Environment Setup                               | Day 8      | Day 14     | 1 Week   | Planning Phase            |
| Backend Development                             | Day 15     | Day 35     | 3 Weeks  | Environment Setup         |
| Frontend Development                            | Day 36     | Day 56     | 3 Weeks  | Backend Development       |
| Testing Phase                                   | Day 57     | Day 63     | 1 Week   | Frontend Development      |
| Deployment Phase                                | Day 64     | Day 70     | 1 Week   | Testing Phase             |
| Documentation and Portfolio Update              | Day 71     | Day 77     | 1 Week   | Deployment Phase          |

### **Final Notes**

- Adjust the durations based on your personal availability and the complexity of each task.
- Use a Gantt chart tool (like Microsoft Project, Asana, or even Excel) to visualize the tasks and their timelines.
- Track your progress regularly and update the Gantt chart as needed to reflect any changes in your project timeline.

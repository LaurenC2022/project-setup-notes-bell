### **Project Structure**

Here’s a high-level outline for structuring your project to make it appealing and informative for a portfolio:

1. **Backend Development (.NET Core)**:
   - Build a REST API using .NET Core to serve as the backend for your React frontend.
   - Integrate NopCommerce as a base for the e-commerce features; customize it by adding new APIs, custom data models, or plugins to showcase your skills.
   - Use Azure SQL Database for data storage and show how you’ve structured your database to support complex e-commerce functionalities.

2. **Frontend Development (React)**:
   - Build a user-friendly and responsive interface using React for the storefront. Include a few custom components to demonstrate your React skills.
   - Show your ability to implement state management (e.g., Redux or Context API) if the application becomes complex enough.
   - Use React Router for client-side navigation and display different sections like Product Listings, Product Details, Cart, and User Dashboard.

3. **Azure Deployment**:
   - Host the .NET Core API on **Azure App Services** and the React frontend on either **Azure Static Web Apps** or also on **App Services**.
   - Use **Azure Blob Storage** for product images and other media.
   - Set up **Azure DevOps** to automate your deployment pipeline with CI/CD for the React frontend and .NET Core API.

4. **Optional Additions**:
   - **User Authentication**: Integrate authentication and authorization, possibly with Azure Active Directory, if relevant.
   - **Payment Integration**: Add a payment gateway for e-commerce realism.
   - **Logging and Monitoring**: Use Azure Application Insights for logging and monitoring your application’s performance and user interactions.

### **Considerations and Challenges**

- **Learning Curve**: This tech stack has a learning curve, especially if you're new to Azure, React, or NopCommerce. Make sure you’re comfortable with each technology and take time to build up your skills if needed.
- **Hosting Costs**: Although Azure offers a free tier, keep an eye on costs as hosting an e-commerce site with multiple services could potentially go beyond the free allowances.
- **Complexity**: NopCommerce is powerful but can be heavy and complex to customize. Make sure you’re prepared to dig into its architecture and modify it effectively.

### **Project Goals to Highlight in Your Portfolio**

- **Technical Proficiency**: Emphasize your use of .NET Core, React, and Azure, as well as your understanding of integrating and customizing NopCommerce.
- **Real-World Relevance**: E-commerce platforms are practical, and employers will appreciate seeing an example of a functional, deployable application.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Showcase any unique challenges you encountered, such as integrating NopCommerce with your custom backend or handling complex Azure deployments.
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Show that you can handle both frontend and backend, along with cloud deployment.
